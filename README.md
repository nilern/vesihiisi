Yet another Lisp.

## Philosophy

* Make the core as elegant as possible.

## Current State

* Rudimentary REPL parsing and printing S-expressions.

## Immediate Goals

* Bytecode compiler
    - TCO
    - Safe for space
* Bytecode VM
* GC

## And Then

* Standard library
* Macroexpansion

## Lofty ambitions

* Multimethods
* Get to a JIT, even if it is just a simple method JIT.
* FFI
